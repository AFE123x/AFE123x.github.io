    <p>This is a project I embarked on before starting college. During that time, my passion for jazz and guitar was at its peak, driving me to take on a unique endeavor. I decided to rearrange the classic jazz tune "Autumn Leaves" specifically for five bassoons. Rearranging a well-known composition like "Autumn Leaves" presented an exciting challenge. I had to carefully adapt the melody, harmonies, and chord progressions to suit the unique qualities and capabilities of the bassoon, while still maintaining the essence of the original piece. The process involved experimenting with different voicings, exploring the tonal range of the bassoon, and considering the expressive techniques that would enhance the interpretation of the music. It required a deep understanding of both the jazz genre and the intricacies of the bassoon as an instrument. Ultimately, I successfully crafted a captivating arrangement of "Autumn Leaves" that showcased the versatility and melodic richness of the bassoon ensemble. It was a gratifying experience to bring together my passion for jazz, guitar, and the bassoon through this project.
        
        The finished arrangement served as a testament to my musical creativity and technical proficiency, and I am proud to include it as part of my musical portfolio.</p>
