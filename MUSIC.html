    <p>This composition is a project I embarked on before starting college. My passion for jazz and guitar peaked during that time, driving me to take on a unique endeavor. I rearranged the classic jazz tune "Autumn Leaves" specifically for five bassoons. Mixing a well-known composition like "Autumn Leaves" presented an exciting challenge. I had to carefully adapt the melody, harmonies, and chord progressions to suit the unique qualities and capabilities of the bassoon while still maintaining the essence of the original piece.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Experimenting with different voicings</li>
    <li>Exploring the tonal range of the bassoon</li>
    <li>Considering the expressive techniques that would enhance the interpretation of the music</li>
</ul>
<p>
It required a deep understanding of the jazz genre and the intricacies of the bassoon as an instrument. Ultimately, I successfully crafted a stunning arrangement of "Autumn Leaves" that showcased the versatility and melodic richness of the bassoon ensemble. It was a gratifying experience to bring together my passion for jazz, guitar, and the bassoon through this project. The finished arrangement stands as a testament to my musical creativity and technical proficiency, and I am proud to include it in my musical portfolio.</p>
