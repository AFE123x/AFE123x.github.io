        <p>This is a project I made for Music Theory IV. The class primarily focused on more modern types of music, but more importantly, it got more abstract. Gone were the days of using notes and writing compositions. In this class, music can be a cacophony of sounds. One famous example of this is John Cage's piece, 4'33. You sit before a piano, opening/closing the piano's critical cover, moving the seat, and many more things for 4 minutes and 33 seconds. This inspired me, and I decided to make this style of composition for my final project. It uses Java's Random and audio library. It will play random clips at random times for 5 minutes. What's most intriguing about this is the idea that the song will differ with each repetition. </p>

            <p>This is a rearrangement of autumn leaves I made in high school. I'm quite a jazz nerd and support that Bassoon can fit in the Jazz scene. Unfortunately, people think otherwise. People think Bassoon is some "divine" instrument and only belongs in classical music. My response? Lmao, no. I was invested in Jazz Theory, reading many books on it. I then took the chords and rearranged them for five bassoons. Looking back at this, it sounds terrible. In Music Theory II, I learned about composing for multiple voices and the set of rules regarding it. I also realized that my intonation back then was way off. My progress is way off the charts, and I'm proud. </p>
