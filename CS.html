<pre>
    I found the opportunity to attend a hackathon led by IEEE and Rutgers Programming Association. I wanted to get experience, meet new people and to have fun. 
I worked with a partner for this project. Rutgers Bed Wars is a yearly competition where a team of 3 design a bed, then race them. One person is on the bed and 
2 people move the bed. The competitors will get points depending on their time. There are also ranked for the bed and costume design and the ammount of donations
they made. It was difficult coming up with a strategy, but my partner and I eventually decided to implement a Max Priority Queue and a scanner tool to count the 
judges ratings. We won first place for this project.

    After a friend showed me their TickTackToe project, I thought I could make it better and I could do it in C++. I implemented corner cases and stuff like that. 
I had fun and I wanted to gain experience with C++. I should learn abt memory management and stuff like that.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/AFE123x/Music-Listening-Quiz-Tool" target="_blank">Music Listening Quiz Tool</a></h2>
<pre>
    This is a project I worked on for music history, and a project that helped me learn complex CS topics, and it was my first project. One requirement I have to take is Music 
History In addition to learning stuff like the similarities between Wagner and Kanye West, we also do these things called listening quizzes. In this quiz, the professor will 
play a random piece at a "random" part. it's not completely random, but it's kinda random. We're supposed to give the name of the composer, name of the piece, time period, type
of piece and when it was composed. The old fashioned way of preparing is to just listen to the pieces and hope for the best. Another way which is also effective is to have a friend
sit across from you and play the pieces. This is also effective, but there's a problem regarding me having no friends. I decided to design a program in java that will be the friend.
This uses many java libraries like it's scanner, file, etc. The scanner will scan a text file containing the info about the music and the name of the audioclip. It will then choose
a random time in the audio clip and play it for 30 seconds. Afterwards, it will ask the user to name the composer, piece, etc.
