<p>
    I've decided to stop being stubborn and finally learn JavaScript. Click the link and you'll be able to access the stuff I made with JavaScript. Enjoy.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/AFE123x/RUPA-BedWars-Hackathon-Project" target="_blank">Rutgers Bed Wars</a></h2>
<p>
I attended a hackathon led by IEEE and Rutgers Programming Association. I wanted to get experience, meet new people, and have fun. I worked with a partner on this project. Rutgers Bed Wars is a yearly competition where a team of 3 design a bed, then race them. One person is on the bed, and two people move the bed. The competitors will get points depending on their time. Judges ranked the competitors for the bed and costume design and the number of donations they made. It was not easy to develop a strategy, but my partner and I eventually decided to implement a Max Priority Queue and a scanner tool to count the judges' ratings. We won first place for this project.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/AFE123x/TikTakToe" target="_blank">TikTakToe Game</a></h2>
<p>
    After a friend showed me their TickTackToe project, I decided to improve it and do it in C++. I implemented corner cases and stuff like that. I had fun, and I wanted to gain experience with C++. I should learn abt memory management and things like that.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/AFE123x/Music-Listening-Quiz-Tool" target="_blank">Music Listening Quiz Tool</a></h2>
<p>
This program is a project I worked on for music history and a project that helped me learn complex CS topics, and it was my first project. One requirement I have to take is Music History. In addition to learning things like the similarities between Wagner and Kanye West, we also do listening quizzes. The professor will play a random piece in this quiz at a "random" part. It's not entirely unexpected, but it's random. We're supposed to give the composer's name, the piece's name, the period, the type of piece, and when it was composed. The old-fashioned way of preparing is to listen to the details and hope for the best. Another way that is also effective is to have a friend sit across from you and play the parts. This approach is also practical, but there needs to be more friends. I decided to design a program in Java that will be my friend. This program uses many Java libraries like its scanner, file, and more. The scanner will scan a text file containing the info about the music and the name of the audio clip. It will then choose a random time in the audio clip and play it for 30 seconds. Afterward, it will ask the user to identify the different aspects of the piece.
