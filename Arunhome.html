<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
	Hello people, my name is Arun Felix. I’m a second year Computer Science and Bassoon performance student at Rutgers University - New brunswick. Outside of academics, I have an interest in electronics, programming (of course!), Biking, weightlifting and learning new things. In addition, I’m a massive car geek. Look out for a Fire black 2021 Ford Escape SE Hybrid when you’re on Doug. I wanted this site to contain my things, ranging from projects to personal write ups. Hopefully you find them interesting. Also, I wanted to get some experience with web dev. I hit the hard realization towards the end that people use react instead? Oh well, HTML, CSS and JS can be fun too.

<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>Computer Science and Music are two different studies. I work on personal projects in both of them, and it's tricky to decide where to put them. I can put my CS projects on github, which is fine. The question is, what about music? I can put it on YouTube, but I can't put my CS projects there. I found middle grounds making a website and uploading my work to respective pages.</p>
