<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Arun Felix, a second year Computer Science student at Rutgers University studying Computer Science and Bassoon Performance. besides my studies, I have interest in other things like electronics, bike riding, gaming and much more. I also love learning new things. One motivation for this site was to fulfill my desire of learning web development. I recently came to the realization that people use react instead, but hey, html, css and js is pretty cool. </p>

<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>Computer Science and Music are two different studies. I work on personal projects in both of them, and it's tricky to decide where to put them. I can put my CS projects on github, which is fine. The question is, what about music? I can put it on YouTube, but I can't put my CS projects there. I found middle grounds making a website and uploading my work to respective pages.</p>
