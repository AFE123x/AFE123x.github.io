                    <p>I'm developing an emulator in C++ because I want to learn more about computers at the low level.
                        It's a project I'm passionate about. I'm working on the 6502 implementation as well. </p>

                    <p>This is a PS2 portable I've been working on starting summer of my freshman year. It's a project I've been wanting to work on,
                        but I haven't found time. At the time, I was an economics major. Now, I'm CS, gained lots of experience in microcontrollers, 
                        and have a 3D printer, it's a project I've been intending to get back on. I also got a new PS2. My goal is to understand how 
                        the PS2 controller works and re-implement it on a microcontroller.
