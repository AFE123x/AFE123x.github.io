    <h2>Music Theory IV Final Project</h2>

    <p>For Theory 4, I had to write a final project. In Music Theory 4, we learned about abstract music types. There's a John Cage piece where he just sits at a piano, doing nothing for 4 minutes and 33 seconds. It's not the usual notes. I was inspired by this and made a composition using Java. It plays random clips at random times for 5 minutes. I was fascinated by it as it'll sound different every time you play it. </p>

    <h2>Autumn Leaves Bassoon Rearrangement</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9IT86EuMKE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>This composition is a project I embarked on before starting college. My passion for jazz and guitar peaked during that time, driving me to take on a unique endeavor. I rearranged the classic jazz tune "Autumn Leaves" specifically for five bassoons. Mixing a well-known composition like "Autumn Leaves" presented an exciting challenge. I had to carefully adapt the melody, harmonies, and chord progressions to suit the unique qualities and capabilities of the bassoon while still maintaining the essence of the original piece.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Experimenting with different voicings</li>
    <li>Exploring the tonal range of the bassoon</li>
    <li>Considering the expressive techniques that would enhance the interpretation of the music</li>
</ul>
<p>
It required a deep understanding of the jazz genre and the intricacies of the bassoon as an instrument. Ultimately, I successfully crafted a stunning arrangement of "Autumn Leaves" that showcased the versatility and melodic richness of the bassoon ensemble. It was a gratifying experience to bring together my passion for jazz, guitar, and the bassoon through this project. The finished arrangement stands as a testament to my musical creativity and technical proficiency, and I am proud to include it in my musical portfolio.</p>
