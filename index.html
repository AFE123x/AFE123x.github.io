<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
Hey there, everyone! I'm Arun Felix, pursuing my second year at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, majoring in Computer Science and Bassoon performance. Besides my academic pursuits, I am keenly interested in electronics, programming (obviously!), biking, weightlifting, and exploring new subjects. I'm also quite the car fanatic. This website's purpose is to showcase various things, ranging from my projects to personal write-ups. I hope you find them intriguing and engaging. Moreover, I wanted to gain some experience in web development, although I eventually realized that people primarily use React for web development. Nevertheless, working with HTML, CSS, and JS can still be enjoyable.

<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>
Computer Science and Music are distinct fields of study, each with its own set of personal projects that I actively work on. However, it can take time to determine where to showcase these projects effectively. Fortunately, I have discovered suitable platforms for both disciplines. For my Computer Science projects, GitHub is an excellent platform for sharing and organizing my work. However, when it comes to music, YouTube has become the go-to platform, although it could be better suited for hosting my Computer Science projects. To find a compromise, I created a website to upload and display my work on separate pages dedicated to each discipline. This way, I can easily direct viewers to the appropriate carrier depending on their interests. By utilizing this approach, I can effectively present my projects in Computer Science and Music, catering to the respective audiences while maintaining a cohesive online presence.</p>
